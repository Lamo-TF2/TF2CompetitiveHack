# TF2CompetitiveHack
This is a cheat that is optimized for competitive TF2. This is not good for hvh or rage. This is as legit as possible. Basically just Dumpster Fire.

# Settings
This is a guide on which settings to use to perhaps never get detected, both by VAC, and by competition admins

# Junk Code
Search up junk code or go to sites such as https://junkcode.gehaxelt.in/ to find junk code.
Make sure your code isn't being optimized because if it is, the junk code gets ignored.
Put junk code in different .cpp files around the cheat, especially the hack files.

# VMProtect
Use a cracked version of VMProctect to protect the cheat even more.

VMProtect your injector as well.
Using these 1st 2 tips will make your cheat undetected from VAC, especially since you are the one making your cheat unique.

# Aimbot
ALWAYS USE SMOOTH
Put your Aim FOV as low as possible. I'd say around 1-2 for sniper, 3 for Ambassador Spy, and 4-5 for the rest of the hitscan classes.
Learn the Magical Ratios:
Lower level of commitment (pugs or scrims) = 5 FOV per 8 smooth
High Level of commitment (matches) = 2 FOV per 8 smooth

Ignore Cloaked is automatically turned on, as I don't need to shoot cloaked enemies anytime.

Turn on Hitscan if you want, it doesn't really matter.
Zoomed Only doesn't really matter either, and Wait for Charge isn't necessary, even for Amby Spy.

ALSO IMPORTANT: Have an aimkey, bind it to your mouse. I have a G502, so I bind my mouse5 to the aimkey.

# ESP
All of these are optimized for being undetected, however, there is one feature that is very important, and key to not being obvious.
ESP KEY
I'll jsut tell you: the easist way of not being detected of cheats is to not have them in the first place.
Here is what I would do.
Use it during spawn, to see what medigun they are using. Especially useful for spy if the enemy medic has a renamed medigun.
Use it during free time, such as rolls or wipes. Use it when the whole enemy team respawns, and give info to your team.
DO NOT use it during direct combat. Do not use it to point your gun to kill someone. Definitely do not use it to kill a cloaked spy
This is in fact one of the easiest ways to detect an ESP. A sniper will be overeager to "accidentally" bump into a spy.
If you want to use ESP to call out a spy:
Turn on CondESP. Make sure you are not near the spy. Only call the spy out once he is decloaked. Again, do not do this during combat,
but only when the enemy team is backed off and you suspect a spy play.
For pyro, these rules are a bit more lenient, but they still apply. You can get away with randomly spewing flames and accidentally 
hitting a spy (also known as spychecking) once or twice, but don't do this the whole game. IF you do this as pyro, that means you
are committing to spychecking every 15 seconds as means to not be obvious or suspicious.

# Triggerbot
Thalash is a great example of what not to do. DO NOT ALWAYS HAVE IT ON. It annoys me so much since PREMIERSHIP players are 
1. Using their SMG with a triggerbot
2. Getting very dumb kills with it.
The Most obvious combo is the ESP and Triggerbot.
PLEASE do not look through a wall and "randomly" place your crosshair next to a wall and respond in under a millisecond.
its dum.

Auto Backstab can be turned on but is very easy to spot.

Auto Airblast is something that you should have a key for. If you are spreading at
1. a soldier
2. a demo
3. a soldier and demo
Turn the key on, and any sudden airblasts can be met with prediction.
DO NOT turn it on when you are spreading at
1. a group of people including both hitscan and not histcan
2. someone who has hitscan only.
It is really obvious when you reflect a projectile that was on the side of you randomly.
Smooth out the aim, but it doesn't really matter.

# Clean Screenshots
All competitive TF2 leagues require a screnshot at the end of each map. Do yourself a favor and don't have a picture showing off
your dank hacks.

# DIY (essential for streaming)
Download the source and search for all instances of LaMAyObox. Delete everything that popus up in the screen and console when injecting.
If you are streaming, don't turn on ESP, and set up your settings befor turning on the stream. 
Worse than getting banned is getting exposed on twitch.

# Final note for any League admins.
Once the code comes out, feel free to contact me. If enough leagues contact me to stop the development of this cheat, I'll stop it.
However, I am also currently working on a document to help detect other cheaters. If you would like a copy of that, I'll be glad 
to send it to you (once I am done).

# Enjoy and compile this yourself
